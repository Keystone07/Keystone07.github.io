   » To day i got a crazy idea to create a website.<br>
  
  <br>The idea occur to me when i was attending my computer science class and an idea struck me that i can create a website own my own with my html knownleadge,
  which made me lose my sleep thinking about what kind of website should i make.
  Anyway i was determine to create a website as the first thing in the morning<br>

  » I begin to make my own website. <br>
  <br>I scavenged youtube so that i wil be prepared with all the tools i needed,
  it's not like i'm not proficient in html or something (trust me bro).I begin to actualy 
  code a website (i did copy paste some codes though) typing,copy pasting ,researching colour was such a tiresome job.
  Still it was fun and i learned a lot from the experience which i way not get from rote learning, some
  tell me reader what do you thing of my website<br>

 <br>» finishing my website and putting it in web.<br>
 <br>Eventhough the website was finished i was'nt able to upload it on the web.The plan was to use github pages 
 which let you create a free web page without the need of buying a domain but every time i upload the html file 
 it keep showing an error, all my effort has gone to waste or so i thought after some research i found a usefull
 website called " validator.w3.org " which let check your html code for error.The funny part about it is that i found 
 tons of error and i was finally able to under why github showed error in my code. It  turnsout that i made a mistake in 
 first line of code instead of typeing (!DOCTYPE html) i wrote "!DOCKTYPE html" the extra "k" rendered the code useless
 as it declares that the code is in html and without that it won't be considered as a html code (i'm stupid)
 i could'nt belive that i made such a mistake.i hope that my code will work,<b> god speed.</b>
